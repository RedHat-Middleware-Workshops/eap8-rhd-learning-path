= Contacts

This is a simple CRUD application to manage contacts. It uses the following Jakarta EE 10 API's:

* https://jakarta.ee/specifications/restful-ws/[Jakarta RESTful Web Services]
* https://jakarta.ee/specifications/cdi/[Jakarta Contexts Dependency Injection]
* https://jakarta.ee/specifications/persistence/[Jakarta Persistence]
* https://jakarta.ee/specifications/bean-validation/[Jakarta Bean Validation]
* https://jakarta.ee/specifications/transactions/[Jakarta Transactions]

The client side is composed of HTML and JavaScript. It receives events from the server (server-sent events) to indicate
when a contact has been added, deleted or modified. The page should then be updated to reflect the changes.

You can also watch events from the http://127.0.0.1:8080/contacts/events.html page when the application is running.
